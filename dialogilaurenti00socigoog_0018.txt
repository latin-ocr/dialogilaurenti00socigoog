proceeded at once to make the episcopal ohaplains his friends,
and bound over the keepers of the 0881319 with an oath to
deliver it into his own hands at their master’s decease. The
plot, save to a scanty few, was a rigid seoret3 the Prior and
the arohdeaoons, the chief officers in the diocese during a
vaoanoy, were in the dark 3 and Cumin hastened to King David
to secure for himself, through his intercession with the 9111-
press, the bishoprio which was so soon to be vacant. If
Geoffrey died before his return all were to be silent as the

parents and friends adopted the strange expedient of embalm-

of the bishop’s decease spread so rapidly that it became 119998-
sary to disolose the fact, and to inter the remains in the
chapter-house of the cathedral where they were recently dis-
covered. Τ1118 was done on the Saturday. On the next day
Oumin returned, having won the assent of David to his
designs, and using the king's name as his warrant, he took into
his own hands the administration of the 899, making friends
whenever he could by the wealth of 1118 promises and the fas-
cination of 1118 address. One arohdeaoon, Robert, he won
over to his side3 the other, Ranulf, a nephew‚ or, perhaps,
natural son, of Bishop Flambard, turned a deas ear to the
seducer. With the barons in the bishoprio Oumin had little
difficulty. Most of them were friendly to David as well as to
the empress, and Oumin himself was well known to them
of old.

All the influenoe of Oumin's increasing party was now
turned upon Roger the Prior* and Arohdeaeon Ranulf, to
