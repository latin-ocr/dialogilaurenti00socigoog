a feather would fall. Stern, however, as he was to the
intrepid archdeacon, to the monks‚ from whom he had
everything to gain, he was 6116111111)Γ 118611. Η18 tricks and
fascinatione were 611 111 16111. King David began now to
see that his selection was an unhappy one, and in Lent‚
1143, Herbert, Abbat of Roxburgh, paid a visit to Durham to
see if his own candidature would be more acceptable. He
had a private interview with four of the chief officers of the
house, but without the slightest success. The spirit of the
men of Durham had risen, and they were not to be won

Oumin in their claims. David fell into the snare 61 01106,

throughout Scotland, rewarded Cumin’s agent with 6 palfrey
and other presente besides. Happily he did not get away
from the country as easily as he desired3 Richard‚ Abbat
01 Μ611086, suspecting the fraud, took the bold step of
arresting the monk, and made him disclose his villainous

proj ect, and its author.
