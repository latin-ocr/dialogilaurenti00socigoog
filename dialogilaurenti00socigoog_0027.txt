soon taken. On the Saturday after Ascension Day Cumin's
nephew‚ the lord of Northallerton‚ appeared with a large

edifice, from the summit of which the eye can search in one
direction the valley of the Wear, in another the long sweep
of marshland which the Skerne and its numerous tributaries
are unable to drain. Before much progress could be made
