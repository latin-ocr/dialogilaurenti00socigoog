David, king of Scotland, the wisest ruler of that sturdy
people. ‘He had acquired from his relatives ι in England
the Norman love of order and system, and in his endeavours
to sow and foster the growth of religion and law among
his people he was far in advance of his subjects and his
time. The Empress Matilda was his niece‚ and he sup-

ported her with enthusiasm. But David had other reasons'

for taking an active part in the commotion which the in-
trusion of Stephen into the English throne was certain
to produce. He was by no means devoid of personal
ambition. Thoroughly English although he was in his
education and feelingS, he had a great longing to be the
lord of those vast tracts of country beyond the Borders
which had at any time been regarded as portions of his
own narrow dominionS, and he did everything in his power
to acquire new rights and claims, as well as to strengthen
the old. He regarded the earldom of Oumberland as his
heritage, and resented the intrusion of an English sheriff
and bishop into that district. The great earldom of
N orthumberland he also asserted was his own in right of
his wife, who was the daughter of 0110 of the official earls,
and the grandchild of another. If David could have secured
this in perpetuity for his race, Scottish influence would

have extended as far as the Tees. Through his son Henry‚
and his nephew William Fitz Duncan, he gained power
far awa)r into the South, whilst in several great English
barons who had fees in the North, such as Eustace Fitz-
John, Robert de BruS‚ Bernard de Balliol, and Hugh de
Moreville, he had friends and aiders who were bound to
assist him when an emergency arose. By slow and cautious
steps David had acquired a position of pre-eminence in the

North which it was difficult to match.
