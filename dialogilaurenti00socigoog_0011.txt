A new power, however, was making itself felt in the
North, and acquiring, by slow progression‚ a position which
no official personage through a long succession of cen·
turies could lessen or destroy. It is not my province to
endeavour to trace the origin of the cluster of franchises

endeavoured to induce Bishop Geoffrey to transfer his
