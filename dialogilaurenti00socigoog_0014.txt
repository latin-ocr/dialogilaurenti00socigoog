Laurence sayS, was a natural impossibility. The arrow that
was shot from the other side of the ravine would ' fall help-

it was aimed. When Bishop Aldhune was on his way from
the south in 995 with the body of St. Outhbert, by a happy
instinct he chose this for his future resting·place. The

of the ground the husbandman had ν drawn his share and
