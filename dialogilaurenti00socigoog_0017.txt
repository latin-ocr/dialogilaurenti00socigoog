permit them to rear the open, half-fortified buildings in
which they subsequently spent 3 great portion of their time.
Here, in Durham, the bishop lay down like a watch-dog before
St. Outhbert's church, too near to be at all times welcome.
The music of the choir could almost be heard by the guards
as they went their rounds upon the lofty keep: In this place

his wishes and mind. Before Easter 1141, Bishop Geoffrey

The disease was so serious that Oumin foresaw the end, and
